Limitless Physiotherapy Website

This website was desgined and build for a physiotherapy company. The goal was to create a responsive front-end React application and then deploy it. The web-app contains several pages that allows the user to find out more information about the clinic and clinician working there. A contact form that is sent directly to the clinician owners email account was also required.

Research was undertaken to look at designs of other local physiotherapy companies. Wireframes were created on Figma. The application was built using React. The application was deployed to Vercel.
